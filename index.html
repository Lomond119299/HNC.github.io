							<b>Listening</b>
							<br>
							<br>
							When I started this course, I had a reality check when it came to listening. 
							Relating to Egan's shadow side of listening, I was not engaging with clients 
							because I was rehearsing what I was going to say rather than attempting to 
							listen to them and empathise. Many of my responses were ineffective and 
							tokenistic because I felt that I needed to do them to pass rather than because 
							I felt that they were of therapeutic value. 
							<br>
							<br>
							I feel that I have majorly improved however, as the stress of ‘getting it right’ 
							has subsided. Though, I am still afraid to take a moment to pause and think of 
							what I am going to say after the client has stopped speaking - I still rehearse 
							what I’m going to say. 
							<br>
							<br>
							My listening outwith counselling sessions have radically improved too. When I hear 
							an opinion I disagree with, I try to put myself in their shoes and empathise with 
							them rather than let my visceral reactions dominate my response. I have a greater 
							appreciation for phenomenology. This, of course, helps me in the counselling room 
							too - not all clients will say favourable things, but it is not my role to agree 
							or disagree with these views and opinions. 
						</td>
						<td>
							<b>Speaking</b>
							<br>
							<br>
							In my first counselling session, I struggled to speak about myself for even ten 
							minutes. I felt confused. I had this impression of myself that I couldn’t shut up,
							but when it came to exploring my emotions I think I still felt really guarded and 
							defensive in being genuine.
							<br>
							<br>
							Additionally, as the counsellor, I found that I was often uncomfortable in taking 
							risks and getting it wrong. I struggled to empathise a lot and, while I think I 
							have made improvements, I feel that I have a long way to go in working on this.
							<br>
							<br>
							I find it a lot easier to open and talk about myself in a genuine manner now. I 
							still use humour as a defence mechanism, but I am trying to move past that. I often 
							feel that I can relate with Gestalt Therapy's idea of Egotism: I delete texts when 
							people didn't respond out of fear that they had negatively judged me. I've made 
							progress in stopping this, and this course has helped raise my self-awareness, but 
							I’m aware of this external locus of evaluation still.  
						</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td style="width:50%; vertical-align: top;">
							<b>Vocabulary</b>
							<br>
							<br>
							I regard vocabulary as a distinct element in communication, especially in this 
							course.
							<br>
							<br>
							Initially, I reused the same basic emotion words – sad, mad, happy. I felt I was 
							struggling to accurately reflect clients’ feelings. I have since improved my 
							language surrounding feelings, especially since reading Therapeutic Communication 
							by D. Corydon Hammond, Dean H. Hepworth, and Veon G. Smith. 
						</td>
						<td style="width:50%; vertical-align: top;">
							<b>Non-Verbal and Body Communication</b>
							<br>
							<br>
							I think I struggle a lot in this outwith counselling sessions.
							<br>
							<br>
							In the counselling sessions, I adopt SOLER and ensure that I come across in an 
							open manner with clients. I also try to use a softer voice when speaking so as 
							not to come across harsh - rather, I want to seem sincere and gentle in 
							responding to clients.
							<br>
							<br>
							However, outwith sessions, I feel that I struggle to come across the right way 
							or use the right body language to convey what I'm trying to convey. This 
							is an area that I'd like to work on more.

				<h3> Counselling Skills and Professional Boundaries </h3>
				<br>
				<br>
				<p> Overall, on reflection, I think have radically improved my counselling skills from the 
				beginning of this course to now. I think an easy way to do my assessment here is to recreate 
				the skills evidence sheet.</p>

							had the experience of dealing with this situation. 
							<br>

							I used to abruptly interrupt the client when ending sessions. While necessary, 
							it was not gentle. I have since made sure to show that I am still interested but 
							that I need to uphold the time boundary.

				<h3>Theoretical approaches to counselling</h3>
				
				<br>
				<br>
				
				<p>
					My knowledge of theory, while enough to pass this course, could do with a lot more development and work, as I don't feel competent or confident in 
					working with any of them. Beyond the Graded Unit, I never had to apply a theory to practice - and I think it would be dangerous to try and do so, 
					given that I do not fully comprehend any of these theories. However, my understanding of the Three Stage Model (although not a theory) is 
					allows me to feel comfortable utilising it with clients.
					
					<br><br>
					<b>Psychodynamic theory</b> has never really been a favourite for me, a lot of the ideas 
					presented by Freud made me feel uncomfortable. In particular, Freud's ideas surrounding 
					penis envy and the oedipus complex are ideas which I do not feel comfortable with. However, 
					credit given where credit is due, I recognise that Freud served as the stepping stone for the entire 
					psychological movement, and he had many ideas which are still being researched today, 
					such as his ideas surrounding childhood trauma (or, as it is more commonly called today, 
					Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs)).
					<br><br>
					While I generally do not like psychoanalysis or the psychodynamic field, Freud's contemporary, Carl Jung, is 
					of great interest to me: His ideas surrounding mysticism and archetypes fascinate me, 
					and I can almost connect to it - especially ideas such as the collective unconscious 
					and genetic memory. I would like to do a lot more research into Jung, but I particularly 
					found comfort in his ideas surrounding archetypes and personality - I find that much of 
					what he said is still relevant today, particularly surrounding the idea of the anima 
					and animus as well as individuation.
					<br><br>
					
					<b>Humanistic theories</b> are all generally ones that I find that I like. 
					
					Carl Rogers's theories are very liberal; freeing. With person-centred counselling, there is no 
					rigid path, no specific way to follow, but rather guidelines which are to be tailored to the 
					client - I like the idea that the right answer is with the client and not the counsellor, and 
					that the client is the theory. His paper on the necessary and sufficient 
					conditions for constructive personality change to occur makes sense too - I believe that 
					the therapeutic alliance generates more positive and effective results than the theory, and 
					that the relationship is more important than the theory ultimately, so Rogers' ideas make 
					sense to me. I have contemplated pursuing this theory and working with it as I find that 
					I connect with it the most.
					<br>
					<br>
					Prior to (and during) this course, I have dealt with panic attacks relating to death and what comes after. 
					That's why Existentialism intrigues me. This theory served as an eye-opener for me and the theory itself made me feel 
					as though I wasn't so alone. Learning about this theory helped me in coping with my own issues, however I do not 
					recall much beyond parts which I personally identified with, and so it is a theory which I would be keen to 
					learn more about.
				<br>
				<br>
				<hr>
				<br>
				
				<h3>Skills and qualities of effective counsellors</h3>
				
				<br>
				<br>
				
				<p>
					I have already established some of the key skills and qualities through my other writing, but the key skill 
					that any counsellor should have is the ability to form, develop and maintain a therapeutic alliance in a 
					safe and supportive environment. The relationship typically accounts for more therapeutic change than the 
					theory, and so it is my view that counsellors should know how to create and form an environment where such 
					a relationship can be fostered, as well as how to foster that relationship. I recognise that empathy and 
					many of the counselling skills which I have learned throughout this course are necessary for a therapeutic 
					relationship to be facilitated, and I feel that I have more learning to do in using these skills in a cohesive 
					manner before I would feel confident in my ability to create a therapeutic alliance.
					<br>
					<br>
					Therapists should, both outwith and within the counselling session, seek to respect phenomenology and 
					keep an open mind towards the views of others. A modern world calls for modern counsellors and, in 
					the UK at least, our culture is changing constantly to become more accepting and tolerant of ideas which 
					were previously condoned - it is therefore, in my eyes, a necessary attribute of any counsellor to keep an 
					open mind and not dismiss anyone because of a disagreement. Counsellors should accept others for their 
					identity and views.Counsellors are not moral guardians or mindguards, and should only challenge
					an individual if there is therapeutic value to it. I believe that I have made a lot of progress throughout this 
					course in becoming more accepting of new language, new ideas and new perspectives.
					<br>
					<br>
					Additionally, relating to mindguards, ounsellors should be able to criticise their favourite theory and recognise
					flaws or critiques in things which they like. Being unable to see and accept holes within a theory, model or 
					idea that you like is hypocritical if you then go on to expect clients to accept any challenges that you provide, 
					or to accept any change. I know that I can be stubborn at times, and may not admit that there are issues with 
					things that I like immediately out of pride, however I often find myself reflecting and recognising the validity 
					in the points of others. I would like to work more on being able to reflect in the here and now, and let go of my 
					pride and stubbornness when it is detrimenting me.	
					<br><br>
					Counsellors should, above all else, act in the best interests of their clients in 
					therapeutic processes. They should demonstrate candour in being open with clients, care and 
					benevolence towards their clients, humility in understanding themselves and their 
					abilities, and integrity in upholding their morals, boundaries, and duties. I think 
					that I have not always acted in the best interests of clients due to me 
					worrying about my own progress and development, but moving on I feel that I 
					have the capability to do so and I believe that I have been moving towards these 
					qualities.
				</p>
				
				<br>
				<br>
				
				<h3> Summary: Strengths, Weaknessess and Areas for Development</h3>
				
				<br>
				<br>
				
				<p>I have developed and formed a lot of strengths throughout this course. I believe that I have become a lot more tolerant of 
				others, even when my visceral reaction is less than willing. I have developed good non-verbal behaviours for my role as a 
				counsellor in one-to-one sessions.
				<br>
				<br>
				In particular, however, I have become open to change. For instance, I have found it a lot easier to speak about myself in an 
				authentic manner, unlike my first session where I struggled to speak for even ten minutes about something close to my heart. 
				I have also changed how I end a session: rather than blatantly interrupting clients, I acknowledge what they are saying and 
				encourage them to continue speaking about it at the next session if they choose, but let them know that our session is drawing 
				to a close. I have also been able to expand my emotional vocabulary, allowing me to more accurately reflect the emotions that 
				clients are expressing.</p>
				
				<br>
				<br>
				
				<p>However, I do still have many weaknesses and areas to develop in.
				<br>
				<br>
				One weakness and area for development is my communication skills. I still continue to rehearse what I am saying and engage in the shadow 
				side of listening rather than remaining fully present with the client. While I cannot be perfect, I can strive to work in the interests of clients 
				and develop my skills better until I have extinguished this behaviour. I also still continue to have an external locus of evaluation when I speak, 
				I worry about what others will think of me or how they will perceive me if I say things - I need to become more confident in owning my thoughts and 
				expressions. I also need to fine-tune my use of a therapeutic silence, knowing when to use them and for how long before it is ineffective. I also need 
				to work on conveying empathy, and how to do so in a way which shows the client that I am really trying to listen.
				
				<br>
				<br>
				
				Another area for development is contingency planning, and knowing how to react in various situations. I am unsure of how to confidently address 
				boundary violations as I have never had to deal with it previously, and I would like experience of this.
				
				<br>
				<br>
				While I have used all three stages of Egan's Three Stage Model, I have never had the experience of doing this with one client, from start to finish. 
				I feel that it is vital to know how to work with a client through this process, as I believe that it can present a whole array of experiences and opportunities 
				that would otherwise not be experienced.
				
				<br>
				<br>
				
				I also need to work on my theoretical knowledge. While having an understanding of counselling skills and a model can help clients, having an understanding 
				of a particular theory would allow me to adequately prepare for and resolve many more situations, such as negative beliefs holding a client back. Being 
				able to draw upon insights from a theory allows me to adequately and ethically resolve situations which I have never encountered before.
				<br>
				<br>
				I should also work on the skills and qualities I identified for an effective counsellor. I recognise that I do not hold a strong grasp on the 
				ability to form and maintain a therapeutic relationship, and I would like to work on this more before working with real clients.</p>

				<h1> Feedback from Others and Self-Assessment Evaluation</h1>
				
				<br><br>
				
				<h2>Lecturers</h2>
				
				<br>
				<p>
					I asked each of my lecturers for comments and feedback on me as a person and student. 
					Keeping confidentiality in mind, I've left out the names of the lecturers and paraphrased 
					what they have said.
				</p>
				<br><br>
				
				<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><b>Lecturer one:</b></h3>
				<br>
				<p style="text-align: justify;">
					<b>Dropping your shoulders.</b> In class you've become a lot more relaxed, 
					open, <em>yourself</em> compared to the start of the course.
					<br>
					<b>The critic:</b> There's a critic inside you. Everyone can see that you're good, but it 
					feels like <em>you</em> can't. You're the only person in your way; there's a critic 
					inside you, but that voice has gotten smaller, weaker.
					<br>
					<b>Stay in your own lane.</b> You get frustrated when others don't do as well as you, 
					or aren't at their best. You're not responsible for how others do. Like swimming, 
					stay in your own lane. Sure, look at others, absorb it all, but focus on your strokes.
					<br>
					<b>How you come across.</b> Sometimes you come across in the wrong way through your facial 
					expressions, body language, tone of voice - the tone of your messages often don't match 
					the intention, and I think that this creates confusion for people.
				</p>
				
				<br><br>
				<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><b>Lecturer two:</b></h3>
				<br>
				<p style="text-align: justify;">
					<b>You're quiet.</b> In class, you don't speak too much - but, when you do contribute, 
					it's good. You also often use humour when talking.
					<br>
					<b>Seating arrangement:</b> You always sit near friends. You don't get to know anyone else 
					around you outside of your friends and you don't lean into the uncomfortable.
					<br>
					<b>Skills practice:</b> You don't ever take the risk, you don't empathise. However, 
					in the Development Phase of the Graded Unit, there was two moments where you used 
					empathy (with one being advanced empathy), however it was lost as you spoke for too long.
					<br>
					<b>Academic work:</b> Your essays have generally been at a high quality, however you 
					totally bombed your Humanistic essay. It was not good at all.
				</p>
				
				<br><br>
				
				<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><b>Lecturer three:</b></h3>
				<br>
				<p style="text-align: justify;">
				<b>Strengths:</b> proactive, engaged, inclusive and able to relate to different people. You appear 
				resilient and adaptable.  Willing to expand into new experiences.
				<br>
				<br>
				<b>Weaknesses:</b> maybe confidence is still growing but with that comes a degree of humbleness 
				which is important.
				<br>
				I think your hold yourself professionally. I wonder if being supportive sometimes shadows 
				other ways in which you can develop people? 
				</p>

					I asked my classmates to fill out, on my laptop, a word form with the feedback they 
					have on me. As I done it at the start of this unit, I am largely unaware of what 
					feedback has came back from which person. Many students filled it out in the same or 
					similar way, so rather than do it by lecturer, I'll do it by "then versus now."
				</p>
				
				<br>
				<br>
				
				<h3 style="text-align: left">At the start</h3>
				
				<br>
				
				<ul style="text-align: justify;">

					<li>I didn't want you to counsel me because I felt you were too young to be hearing

					changed as a person aswell as grew in confidence, keep being you logan coz you will make 
					a fantastic counsellor.</li>
					<br>
					<li>My view on you has completely changed after getting to know you, you are knowledgeable 
					and full of really interesting facts, and I now know that instead of you being opinionated

					<li>Very knowledgeable and passionate about learning more.  Talks to everyone, creating

					There are clearly mixed opinions on me, and I clearly have a lot of work to do socially. 
					But, more importantly, a lot of this doesn't match up with what I thought in my initial 
					self-evaluation.
					
					<br><br>
					In my initial self-evaluation, I said that I have learned to listen to people with 
					no judgement and without letting my visceral reaction dominate my response. But a lot 
					of the feedback here has been that I can be intimidating, judgemental, and that I 
					don't take on the views of others. This inconsistency shows that there's more work to 
					do here. I should work on being able to put myself in the shoew of others when 
					listening to new and opposing views. Many thought I was arrogant when giving opinions, 
					too. I want to improve and be gentler and more sensitive when giving my thoughts and views. 
					<br><br>
					In my self-evaluation, I said that the relationship matters more than the theory. But, 
					when it came to relationships, I think I struggled. At the start, it’s been noted that I 
					didn’t make the greatest first impressions: I was quiet, reserved, unapproachable. And, 
					when I did begin to open up more, I came across as arrogant with my opinions. I also came 
					across as intimidating and judge-y sometimes. Especially if I want to pursue counselling. 
					<br><br>
					With my communication, I don’t always come across in a sincere and accurate way – my tone 
					and body language doesn’t match the way that I mean to say things; I come across the wrong 
					way. I also often resort to using humour as a defence mechanism when I’m comfortable or 
					anxious, as a substitute for being genuine. So, trying to be more sincere and genuine, 
					using less humour in the face of discomfort, and learning how to have my nonverbal 
					communication match my verbal are areas for improvement still. 
					<br><br>
					But, going below the surface, I do still have that critic, I don't feel confident in my 
					own work, and I am scared that I will fail, despite having passed this course comfortably. 
					And when it comes to skills practice, the feedback here is consistent with my 
					initial self-evaluation: I was hesitant in taking that risk in empathising, 
					although the lecturer that had noted that has also recognised that I showed two attempts at 
					empathy in the Graded Unit. So working on empathy and taking that risk is something I 
					really want to work on.
					
					<br><br>
					Overall, my initial self-evaluation in terms of my counselling skills is consistent with 
					the comments I've received: I am improving, but I still need to work more and get used to 
					taking that risk in understanding the client's frame of reference. However, I was completely 
					off the mark when it came to how I am socially. I thought that my ability to listen had 
					improved, but clearly I have a lot more work to do than I thought, as others feel that 
					I am still showing judgement and that I am unable to put myself in their shoes if I have 
					already formed an opinion which opposes theirs.

				<h2>Journaling</h2>
				<br>
				<p> I think I have developed a great deal throughout this course. I share these following 
				extracts, despite that they are private and that I am even uncomfortable with some of the 
				content in hindsight.</p>
				<br>
				
				<h3> 1st September, 2022</h3>
				<p><em>"I’m a little unsociable, so I didn’t really talk to anyone for the first few minutes, but 
				I did want to say hello. I’m just a little awkward. I got my first opportunity to talk when someone 
				asked where the bathroom was, which we all passed by on the way to class. I like to think that I’m 
				observant enough to notice the small details and, for once, me noticing those sorts of things was 
				useful. It wasn’t much of a conversation, but it was a starter. Then someone sat next to me, who was 
				quite friendly. He’s a lot older and he has quite the story to tell, but he makes for good company. 
				I don’t think I’d feel comfortable necessarily saying he’s my friend because of the age gap, but had 
				he been younger, I’d be glad to have done so. I suppose that it’s me, then, who makes the age gap 
				between me and everyone else an issue then. Regardless, I get quite well along with him. He’s smarter 
				than I imagine a lot of people would take him for, and he seems genuinely interesting."</em></p> 
				
				<br>
				<p>I felt really uncomfortable reading all of that, and cringed at some parts. But I resisted the urge 
				to delete and amend any of that extract, because I know that those were my honest thoughts and feelings, 
				and that I'm doing this in the pursuit of authenticity and developing myself - as Carl Jung said, 
				"We cannot change anything unless we accept it. Condemnation does not liberate; it oppresses."
				
				<br>
				One fear that I had was that age would be an issue in this course. At times, my age has been 
				brought up by classmates and not in so much of a positive manner, but I have been able to 
				persevere and accept that people view me the way that they view me. Some have even 
				commented, as seen above, that their perceptions on me radically changed after having me 
				as the counsellor in a session, and age was no longer a barrier for them. Hearing that 
				made me feel really relieved. </p>
				
				<br>
				
				<h3>11th November, 2022</h3>
				<p><em>"That counselling session was absolutely mortifying throughout. My client was the lecturer, 
				which was just a terrifying experience for me – but, thinking about that, it’s only scary because 
				I’m focusing on her and the feeling of her judging me is much more prevalent."</em></p>
				<br>
				<p> In hindsight, the session really didn't go as badly as I wrote. I remember a lot of the feedback 
				that the lecturer gave, including that I handled certain unexpected events well even though it 
				may have thrown me off. Having the lecturer as my client felt really intimidating, but I still 
				did well in that session despite so. I think I would still be scared if I had a lecturer as a 
				client, looking past their title or position is something I will need to work on.</p>
				
				<br>
				
				<h3> 3rd February, 2023</h3>
				<p><em>"I asked Carolanne for feedback. She asked if I wanted it in private or in public, 
				and I immediately said “yeah go for it do it publicly” - but this isn’t what I would’ve 
				wanted. I think I said it because I wanted to look brave, or not embarrassed."</em></p>
				
				<br>
				<p>I think that using this piece is interesting because it relates to this unit - at the time, 
				I was seeking feedback from lecturers and coursemates on me as a person. I acted in a manner 
				that betrayed what I really wanted, because I didn't want to seem awkward or scared. I think, now,
				I have become a lot more confident in speaking in my own interests.</p>
				
				<br><br>
				
			<h2>Personality and Attachment Tests</h2>
			<br>
			<h3>Myers-Briggs Personality Test</h3>
			<p>I learned that I hold an INFP personality (meaning introversion, intuition, feeling and perceiving). 
			INFP types are allegedly sensitive, creative, idealistic, perceptive, caring, loyal. They value inner 
			harmony and personal growth, and focus on dreams and possibilities. I relate a lot to being sensitive 
			and idealistic, wanting to focus on my dreams rather than taking a pragmatic approach. I think that 
			this personality type fits me best.</p>
			<br>
			
			<h3>Eysenck Personality Test</h3>
			<p> This test reflects the ideas of Hans Eysenck a pioneer in the field of personality research. 
			Through research and statistical analysis he determined that personality is composed of three main 
			elements: Extroversion, Neuroticism, and Psychoticism. My results on this test were that I am low 
			in extroversion, high in neuroticism, and low in psychoticism.
			
			<br><br>
			Extroversion results were moderately low which suggests I are reclusive, quiet, unassertive, 
			and private. I both agree and disagree with this - I am reclusive and quiet around individuals 
			I do not know, but I become a lot more forthcoming and open with people that I am familiar with. I 
			do not think that I am private.
			<br>
			<br>
			Neuroticism results were high which suggests I am very worrying, insecure, emotional, and 
			anxious. There's not much to say about this other than that I agree - I am insecure and 
			deeply emotional, however I tend to reserve these emotions.
			<br>
			<br>
			Psychoticism results were low which suggests I am overly kind natured, trusting, and helpful 
			at the expense too often of my own individual development (martyr complex). I used to be quite 
			like this, and would disregard my own needs and wants in favour of pleasing others, but I have 
			majorly changed this. I still want to make others happy, but I am making space for myself while 
			doing so.
			<br><br>
			<h3>Grit Scale</h3>
			The Grit Scale measures the extent to which individuals are able to maintain focus and interest, 
			and persevere in obtaining long-term goals. The maximum score on this scale is 5 (extremely gritty), 
			and the lowest score on this scale is 1 (not at all gritty).
			<br><br>
			After completing this test, I scored a 2. This sounds accurate, as I easily lose motivation at the 
			first setback and struggle to commit to many things long-term outside of education.
			</p>
			
			<br><br>
			
			<h3>Attachment Theory Test</h3>
			<p>
			According to the test, I have an anxious-preoccupied attachment style.
			<br><br>
			People who anxiously attach tend to worry more about their relationships. They are said to 
			experience an ’emotional hunger’ and are desperate for a fantasy type of love. Unlike securely 
			attached people, people with an anxious attachment tend to be desperate to form a fantasy bond 
			of ideal love–even when this might not be possible or reciprocated. They tend to look for a 
			partner who can rescue them or ‘complete’ them. Unfortunately, their desperation sometimes can 
			push away the exact person they want closeness with. When they are afraid of losing their partner, 
			they can become clingy, possessive, paranoid, or need constant attention.
			<br><br>
			While I hold anxieties surrounding the security of the relationship, I reject the idea that 
			the partner completes or fixes me. I think I do require affection, but I don't see it as something 
			that needs 'completed'.

				<h1> Areas for Improvement </h1>
				<p><em>‘The process of getting to know your feelings, attitudes and values. It is also 
				learning about the effect you have on others’ -Philip Burnard on self-awarness, Effective 
				Communication Skills for Health Professionals.</em>
				
				<br><br>
				
				<h3> Professional Development and Reflective Practice </h3>
				
				<br><br>
				
				<p>
				Self evaluation is essential in counselling training and practice. Self-evaluation requires 
				self-awarness and integrity, and means closely and critically examining one's performance - in 
				this case, examining my performance throughout this course, helping me identify strengths and 
				learning needs. This has included looking at my understanding of theory and how it is applied 
				in practice, my relationship with and impact on others and my strengths and learning needs 
				with regard to the skills and qualities required of counsellors. This Unit has given me the 
				opportunity to reflect on myself in relation to all aspects of the course and can be seen as a 
				‘summary’ of my experiences on the course including understanding of theory, personal 
				development and workplace practice.
				</p>
				
				<br><br>
				
				<h3> My learning style </h3>
				<br><br>
				
				<p>
				When it comes to my learning style, I think I am more of a kinesthetic learner.
				<br>
				I don't think that I am a particularly slow talker, but I am slow to make a decision. I also 
				really enjoy being able to demonstrate the learning and put it into practice, using all of 
				my senses when engaging in learning and taking a hands-on approach with trial and error 
				helps to ingrain it.
				<br><br>
				The reason I bring this up is because it helps explain why I have chosen to take hands-on 
				experiential approaches to continuing my personal and professional development.
				</p>
				
				<h3> Communication and counselling skills </h3>
				
				<p> In the initial self-assessment, I identified several areas of development. 
				Communication and counselling skills, such as empathy, therapeutic silence, and developing 
				and maintaining a therapeutic relationship were all areas which I felt I was lacking in or 
				needing to develop further, as well as using Egan's Three-Stage Model on a long-term 
				client relationship.
				<br><br>
				I want to develop my skills more before I start to work with clients, and doing this self-evaluation 
				has helped me realise that. That is why I have decided to reject the offer for the Higher National 
				Diploma in Counselling, and instead pursue the COSCA Certificate in Counselling Skills first. I 
				hope to be able to pursue this with either Ayrshire College or the Glasgow Council on Alcohol - 
				at time of writing, I have an unconditional offer to study with the latter.
				<br><br>
				In the Evaluation and Feedback stage of the self-evaluation, two major pieces of feedback 
				that I received were about my initial quietness and how I come across. Many individuals 
				stated that they didn't get along with me originally, felt I was shy, and felt that I 
				didn't talk much - to work on this, I'm going to build my social confidence through 
				volunteering with an addictions service, ideally East Ayrshire Recovery Hub.
				<br><br>
				Many classmates alos said that I come across wrong, that my body language doesn't seem 
				to match how I intend to come across. To develop this, I'm going to continue to enter 
				social situations and work on my communication skills through my counselling training. 
				I hope that this, then, will help me in becoming more sincere and accurate in conveying 
				the tone I hope to express.
				</p>
				
				<br><br>
				
				<h3>Theories</h3>
				<p>
				I have also recognised that I want/need to develop further my knowledge on theories, 
				particularly cognitive-behavioural and person-centred therapies. I am really keen to work with 
				addictions, which is why I would like to study cognitive-behavioural theory, but I 
				want to work in an eclectic style and integrate elements of person-centred therapy. The COSCA 
				Certificate in Counselling Skills will help me to develop my understanding of them more, but 
				I will also undertake a course in Cognitive Behavioural Theory afterwards (if that still 
				remains my desired path).
